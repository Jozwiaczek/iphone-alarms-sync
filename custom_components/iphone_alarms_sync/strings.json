Create a new Shortcut on your iPhone/iPad\n2. Add \"Call Home Assistant Service\" action\n3. Select one of the alarm event services above\n4. Set `phone_id`: `{phone_id}`\n5. For `report_alarm_event`: Set `alarm_id` to the alarm UUID (shown above, can also use full format like \"x-apple-clock:alarm?id=UUID\" - UUID will be extracted automatically)\n6.
