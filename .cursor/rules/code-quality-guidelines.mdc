# Code Quality & Development Guidelines

## Clean Code Principles

### Naming & Structure
- **Meaningful Names**: Variables, functions, and classes should reveal their purpose
- **Constants Over Magic Numbers**: Replace hard-coded values with named constants at the top of the file
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function does exactly one thing and is small and focused
- **Clean Structure**: Keep related code together in a logical hierarchy
- **Encapsulation**: Hide implementation details, expose clear interfaces

### File Organization
- **Small Files**: Prefer splitting files into multiple smaller ones, keeping each at ~100 lines maximum
- **The smaller, the better**: Generally, fewer lines per file makes code easier to navigate and understand
- **Utils & Hooks**: Keep utilities and hooks especially small - ideally ~50 lines maximum
- **Extract Components/Utils**: If a file grows beyond limits, extract components, utilities, or hooks into separate files
- **Single Responsibility per File**: Each file should have a clear, focused purpose

### Code Quality
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Extract repeated code into reusable functions
- **No Comments**: Code should be self-documenting through clear naming. Never add comments - neither obvious ones that describe what code does (e.g., "// render button", "// loop through items") nor explanatory ones. If code needs explanation, refactor it to be clearer
- **Refactor Continuously**: Fix technical debt early, leave code cleaner than you found it

## Development Workflow

### Code Changes
- **Verify Information**: Always verify before presenting. No assumptions or speculation
- **File-by-File**: Make changes file by file for easier review
- **Single Chunk Edits**: Provide all edits for a file in one chunk
- **Preserve Existing Code**: Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities

### Communication Style
- Never use apologies
- Don't summarize changes or give understanding feedback
- Don't show current implementation unless requested
- Don't ask for confirmation of info already in context
- Don't suggest whitespace changes or unnecessary updates
- Provide real file links, not x.md

### What NOT to Do
- Don't invent changes beyond explicit requests
- Don't ask user to verify implementations visible in context
- Don't suggest updates when no modifications needed

## Solution & Architecture

### Simplicity First
- **Prefer simple solutions**: Straightforward > clever
- **Readability over cleverness**: Code should be obvious to other developers
- **When in doubt**: Choose the simpler approach

### Dependency Management
- Remove unused dependencies from `package.json`
- Verify if existing code can achieve the goal before adding new dependency
- Clean up both code AND `package.json` when removing package

## Testing

### When to Test
- ✅ Add tests for complex logic (array/object manipulation, calculations, conditions)
- ❌ Skip tests for simple logic, configurations, React components

### Test Principles
- Keep tests extremely short, simple, focused on key functionality
- Apply DRY and KISS to tests
- Extract setup functions, utils, mock data to beginning of file
- **Minimize mocking**: Extract logic to testable utilities
- **Component extraction**: Extract logic from components to utilities
